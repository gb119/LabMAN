LabMAN - django based Research Lab Management Tool
##################################################

Introduction
------------

Managing a research lab with multiple users who are variously expert (or not) at using multiple bits of kit, keeping track of
safety training records and providing a fair means to book time on equipment is a major hassle. This project is working towards making
these processes easier by providng an integrated web based tool to handle these tasks and devolve responsibilities among a user base.

Status
------

Currently this is work in progress. There is no functional web tool yet - it is simply developing the logic within a series of
interconnected django apps.

Prerequisites
-------------

django is a Python based web framework. Cuyrrently we are targetting django 1.9 running on Python 2.7
